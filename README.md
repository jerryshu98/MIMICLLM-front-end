# MIMICLLM-front-end

This project is the front-end interface for the MIMIC LLM project. It allows users to interact with the MIMIC LLM backend, which processes clinical data and offers AI-driven insights.
> **Reminder:**  
> Due to access restrictions on our model, responses might sometimes be slower than usual. Additionally, the model has a limit on the number of tokens per input, so we recommend starting a new conversation box for each query to ensure smooth operation. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
